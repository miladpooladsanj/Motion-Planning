    "# King's Planning Problem\n",
    "The king's planning problem was given as a take-home project by Instock. In the following section, we describe the problem formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "Design and implement in code a Planner algorithm for a square chessboard of arbitrary size with certain cells marked red as restricted areas. There are $N$ kings on the board, each with a specific target cell to reach. The kings move sequentially, one by one, one step at a time ($K_1$ step1, $K_2$ step1…. $K_1$ step2, $K_2$ step2…), and must adhere to two main rules: they cannot move into restricted cells, and they cannot end a move adjacent to another king (including diagonally). A king may stay in place (empty move). The task is to compute a path for each king to its target, ensuring compliance with the movement rules and the sequential order of moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input\n",
    "Planner’s input would be given as 2 files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- File1: king starting and target positions\n",
    "  x_from, y_from, x_to, y_to\n",
    "\n",
    "- File2: chessboard size and restricted areas\n",
    "  $S$,\n",
    "  $x$, $y$,\n",
    "  where $x$ and $y$ are integer coordinates starting from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Restrictions\n",
    "- If plan (solution) does not exist, Planner should detect and output that plan does not exist.\n",
    "- If plan does exist, Planner should output a plan in format: x_from, y_from, x_to, y_to, where each line is one step of one king, and king_id would be deduced by a test program from “from” coordinates.\n",
    "- For a 100x100 chessboard size the Planner should finish planning in reasonable time.\n",
    "- The Planner program should use not more than 1GB of RAM.\n",
    "- A reasonable simple visualization would be a plus but is not a requirement.\n",
    "- Your ideas on optimality of your algorithm would be a valuable add-on when discussing your solution on a call.\n",
    "- Implementations can be done in Go, C++ or python.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Planner Magnus\n",
    "In this section, we introduce our planning algorithm, called Planner Magnus, and provide its implementation in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Notations\n",
    "For a set $\\mathcal{A}$, let $|\\mathcal{A}|$ denote its cardinality. Given an integer $n$, we use $[n]$ to denote the set $\\{1, 2, \\cdots, n\\}$. We let $\\mathcal{K}$ be the set of kings, where $|\\mathcal{K}| = N$. We let $\\mathcal{I}$ be the set of squares on the chess board, and $\\mathcal{I}_{s}$ be the set of restricted squares. For king $k \\in \\mathcal{K}$, let $o_k \\in \\mathcal{I}$ denote its initial square and $d_k \\in \\mathcal{I}$ denote its target square. With a slight abuse of notation, given a square $i \\in \\mathcal{I}$, we let $\\text{adj}(i)$ denote all of its adjacent squares *and* square $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimization Framework\n",
    "Since empty moves are allowed, the sequential order of moves is redundant. In other words, the problem is equivalent to a planning problem with no constraint on the sequential order of moves. We now describe the optimization framework used in the proposed planner (Planner Magnus). For a given king $k \\in \\mathcal{K}$, we define a binary variable $w_{i,t}^{k}$, which indicates whether king $k$ is occupying square $i$ of the chess board at time $t$ (if $w_{i,t}^{k} = 1$) or not (if $w_{i,t}^{k} = 0$). \n",
    "\n",
    "Planner Magnus solves an optimization problem in order to find a path (if it exists) for all the kings. Since the goal is merely to find a path, we cast the problem as a feasiblity problem with the following constraints:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "w_{o_k, 1}^{k} &= 1,~~~ \\forall k \\in \\mathcal{K}, \\label{eq:initial-condition} \\tag{1} \\\\\n",
    "w_{d_k, T}^{k} &= 1,~~~ \\forall k \\in \\mathcal{K}, \\label{eq:final-condition} \\tag{2} \\\\\n",
    "w_{i, t}^{k} &= 0,~~~ \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{I}_{s},~ \\forall t = 1, \\cdots, T,~ \\forall k \\in \\mathcal{K}, \\label{eq:resrticted-square} \\tag{3} \\\\\n",
    "\\sum_{j \\in \\text{adj}(i)} w_{j, t + 1}^{k} & \\geq w_{i, t}^{k},~~~ \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{I},~ \\forall t = 1, \\cdots, T-1,~ \\forall k \\in \\mathcal{K}, \\label{eq:king-move} \\tag{4} \\\\\n",
    "\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}}w_{i,t}^{k} &= 1,~~~ \\forall t = 1, \\cdots, T,~ \\forall k \\in \\mathcal{K}, \\label{eq:occupy-one-square} \\tag{5} \\\\\n",
    "w_{i,t}^{\\ell} + \\sum_{j \\in \\text{adj}(i)} w_{j, t}^{k} &\\leq 1,~~~ \\forall t = 1, \\cdots, T,~ \\forall k \\in \\mathcal{K}: k \\neq \\ell, \\label{eq:no-two-kings-adj} \\tag{6} \\\\\n",
    "w_{i, t}^{k} &\\in \\{0, 1\\},~~~ \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{I},~ \\forall t = 1, \\cdots, T,~ \\forall k \\in \\mathcal{K}. \\label{eq:w-binary} \\tag{7}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here,  $T$ is a rough upper bound on the time it takes for all the kings to reach their target squares, and is determined by the user. Constraints \\eqref{eq:initial-condition} and \\eqref{eq:final-condition} enforce the initial and final condition of all kings, respectively. Constraint \\eqref{eq:resrticted-square} ensures that no king can occupy the restricted squares at any time. Constraint \\eqref{eq:king-move} ensures that, upon occupying a sqaure, a king either stays in that square or moves to an adjacent square in the next move. Constraint \\eqref{eq:occupy-one-square} ensures that each king occupies exactly one square, and constraint \\eqref{eq:no-two-kings-adj} ensures that no two kings occupy adjacent squares during the planning horizon. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark)** While an optimization framework seems like a natural choice to solve this problem, it certainly is not the only approach. Other choices such as Dynamic Programming (DP) and Breath-First Search (BFS) algorithms are also solid options to consider. However, the provided optimization framework seems to be more flexible, especially if the user needs more than just finding a plan, e.g., a plan that minimizes the total time it takes for all kings to reach their target squares. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "Among the plethora of options, we choose the *PuLP* library to implement and solve the integer linear program described in Planner Magnus. PuLP is a modeling framework for linear and integer programming problems in Python that relies on a solver to compute a solution. One advantage of PuLP over other frameworks is that it works with many popular solvers such as CPLEX, Gurobi, and COIN. Here, we use the Gurobi solver, which is considered to be the state-of-the-art in solving integer linear programs. References [1-3] at the end of this report provide instructions on how to set up PuLp and Gurobi. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although Gurobi is quite efficient, it still suffers from the curse of dimensionality, i.e., computational time increases exponentially as the problem size increases. To overcome this issue, we implement Planner Magnus using an *incremental batch* approach. That is, we first divide the kings into batches, starting from batch size of 1. We then use Planner Magnus to find a plan for each batch while keeping other kings idle. If a plan is not found, we increase the batch size until a plan is found (if any). As we will see, this approach improves computational time substantially.  "

    "## Results\n",
    "In this section, we discuss the performance of Planner Magnus for the 10 problem tests provided. For all problem tests, we set $T = 2S$, where $S$ is the size of the chess board, and use the default Gurobi parameters. We also use an incremental batch approach described in Section 2.3, starting from batch size of 1. All problem sets were run on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz   3.19 GHz desktop computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In problem test 1, there are $N = 8$ kings located on an $8 \\times 8$ chess board. Planner Magnus takes about 9.0 seconds to find a plan for this case using a batch size of $8$ (the king moves are stored in \"king_moves_1.txt\"). On the other hand, for problem test 2, which includes $N = 8$ kings on a $16 \\times 16$ chess board, Planner Magnus is able to find a plan in about 9.6 seconds using a batch size of $1$ (the king moves are stored in \"king_moves_2.txt\"). As we can see, even though the size of problem test 2 is twice the size of problem test 1, we are able to control the computational speed by using the incremental batch approach. The results from all simulation runs are shown in Table below: \n",
    "\n",
    "- simulation test 3: plan exists, batch size 1, 26.2 seconds\n",
    "- simulation test 4: plan exists, batch size 1, 13.0 seconds\n",
    "- simulation test 5: plan exists, batch size 3, 229.7 seconds\n",
    "- simulation test 6: plan exists, batch size 1, 833.6 seconds\n",
    "- simulation test 7: plan exists, batch size 2, 303.2 seconds\n",
    "- simulation test 8: plan exists, batch size 1, 183.6 seconds\n",
    "- simulation test 9: plan exists, batch size 1, 114.2 seconds\n",
    "- simulation test 10: plan exists, batch size 3, 0.4 seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see from Table, Planner Magnus performs very well in all cases. However, we might still face some issues with computational time if small batch sizes lead to no feasible plans. Potential solutions to overcome this issue include using memoization, reducing the size of the problem by dividing the chess board into smaller sub-boards, and relaxing the optimization problem by looking for approximate solutions. A recent example of the latter approach can be found in [4], where the authors use neural networks to store the integer part of a mixed linear integer program, and use the neural network to solve new instances of the problem in milliseconds.
